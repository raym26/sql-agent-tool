# SQL Conversations: Building an Intelligent Database Query Assistant

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to create an AI-powered SQL agent that translates natural language questions into database queries. The system provides both accurate results and transparency into its reasoning process. By leveraging LangChain's SQL agent framework paired with a language model, we've built a system that allows non-technical users to extract insights from databases through simple questions while giving developers visibility into the agent's step-by-step thought processâ€”from question interpretation to SQL formulation to answer generation.

## Features

- Natural language to SQL query translation
- Step-by-step reasoning trace for transparency
- Custom output formatting for clean result presentation
- Works with any SQL database supported by LangChain

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- A compatible language model (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- SQLAlchemy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-agent-tool.git
cd sql_agent_tool

2. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up your environment variables for your language model API keys

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook SQL_Agent_Demo.ipynb

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
- Connect to your database
- Create the SQL agent
- Ask natural language questions
- View the agent's reasoning process
- Customize the output format

## Example

```python
# Create the SQL toolkit and agent
toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)
agent = create_sql_agent(
 llm=llm,
 toolkit=toolkit,
 verbose=True
)

# Run the agent
result = agent.run("Who are the customers that have spent more than $500?")
print(result)
